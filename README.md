# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia-Using-Classification-Algorithms
This project was developed as part of the Honors segment in the IBM Machine Learning course on Coursera.

Overview
The objective of this project was to build a classifier capable of predicting whether it will rain the following day. To achieve this, we utilized a dataset provided by the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

Approach
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the rainfall dataset to make it suitable for analysis.
Model Building: Applied various classification algorithms to create predictive models using the training data.
Evaluation: Assessed the performance of these models on the testing data using a range of evaluation metrics.
Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics
The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R2-Score
